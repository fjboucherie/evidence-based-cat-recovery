# Evidence-Based Missing Cat Recovery Protocol

Crisis management tools for pet owners searching for lost cats, based on peer-reviewed research.

**Status:** Work in progress - open for feedback

## About This Project

Developed through 3+ years of active missing cat search work in the Netherlands, with a high recovery success rate (109 recoveries, 110 total searches)
**The gap:** Pet owners receive conflicting advice during crisis. Shelters lack standardized, evidence-based protocols.

**This solution:** Synthesizes 150+ pages of peer-reviewed behavioral research into accessible 1-page tools, field-tested during real search operations.

**Status:** Continuous improvement based on case outcomes and community feedback.

## What's Included

- Crisis flowcharts (Dutch)
- Day 1-7 protocols 
- Late-entry protocols (for people starting search after week 1)
- Equipment guides
- Templates and checklists

## How to Use

Download the Word documents, adapt to your specific case, and follow the protocol matching your cat's profile (indoor-only, indoor-outdoor, or outdoor-access).
