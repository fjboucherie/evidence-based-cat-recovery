# Evidence-Based Missing Cat Recovery Protocol

## About This Project

Developed through 3+ years of active missing cat search work in the Netherlands, with a high recovery success rate (100%). 

**The gap:** Pet owners receive conflicting advice during crisis. Shelters lack standardized, evidence-based protocols.

**This solution:** Synthesizes 150+ pages of peer-reviewed behavioral research into accessible 1-page tools, field-tested during real search operations.

**Status:** Continuous improvement based on case outcomes and community feedback.
Crisis management tools for pet owners searching for lost cats, based on peer-reviewed research.

**Status:** Work in progress - open for feedback
